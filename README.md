# Snake Clone
A mock-up project that imitates the classic Snake game, made in Godot 4.3. Here, the snake, instead of growing in size instantly, grows when the eaten "egg" reaches the end of its tail (as in Snake II).

## Instructions
Orient the snake's head with the arrow keys. Get eggs to increase your score and size. If you collide with the screen border or the snake's body, you lose.
